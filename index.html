          ><p>Dear Colleagues,



<p>It is my pleasure to present my application for promotion to the rank of Professor in the Department of Computer Science at SUNY Potsdam. I joined SUNY Potsdam's Computer Science faculty as an Associate Professor in August 2016, and was awarded continuing appointment in August 2018. I have served as Department Chair since the summer of 2018.

<p>My dedication to undergraduate teaching is what brought me to SUNY Potsdam. I am fortunate to find myself among like-minded department colleagues. Since 2018, the Computer Science faculty have transformed our degree programs. We revised and expanded the the introductory sequence to include a new third course (CIS 205 Computer Science III), created three program tracks within the Bachelor of Science degree (General, Data Analytics, Cybersecurity), and streamlined the Bachelor of Arts program as a single track. These curricular revisions were accomplished over a period of five years, through a highly collaborative process. I am very pleased to have contributed to an updated curriculum that builds on the strong foundation of more than 50 years of Computer Science at SUNY Potsdam and positions the department and our students for the future.

<p>Since coming to SUNY Potsdam, I have taught 10 different Computer Science courses that span the Computer Science curriculum, from CIS 201 Computer Science I to CIS 495, a special topics course in "Bio-inspired Artificial Intelligence". In 2020, I also co-developed (with Dr. Brian Ladd) and taught a new section of WAYS 103, "Algorithms of Oppression". My experience teaching WAYS 103 was deeply rewarding, affording me the opportunity to work with students from across the university. Working with individual students on projects and academic advising is an important aspect of my teaching. I have supervised 30 Capstone projects since coming to Potsdam, a mix of senior projects and internships. I have advised many Computer Science major and minor students, averaging 15-20 students each year.

<p> I have remained active in my scholarly communities through publications, presentations, technical committees, journal reviews, professional organizations, and grant applications. More details are given in the summary narrative and scholarly activities sections, below, and the full citations for my publications and lists of presentations and other activities are available in my <em>curriculum vitae</em>.

<p>I have taken on many service roles over the years at SUNY Potsdam. I have served as Computer Science Department Chair since 2018 and in many capacities at the university level, including Faculty Senate Vice-chair (2020-2022), Faculty Senate Delegate, member of the Academic Programs and Curriculum Committee (APCC) and Business Affairs Committee (BAC), and the Artificial Intelligence Task Force. I serve on the CSTEP Advisory Board and the Jefferson County Community College Computer Science Advisory Board.

<p>Full details of my teaching, scholarly, and service activities are available in the sections of this webpage and in my <em>curriculum vitae</em>. For more information about accessing the detailed information, please see the note ("N.B.") below.

<p>I am grateful to be part of the SUNY Potsdam community and for the privilege of serving our students, department, school and university in my time so far. I am grateful for the opportunity to share my work with you through this portfolio and look forward to an exciting future with my colleagues, students, and all the SUNY Potsdam community.


<p>Sincerely,
<p>Laura M. Grabowski

          <p>Teaching continues to be exciting, energizing, and motivating. As a faculty in Computer Science at SUNY Potsdam, I have the opportunity to teach students at every stage of their undergraduate education, from freshman through senior. It is deeply gratifying to watch students grow in skills, understanding, and confidence, becoming early career professionals before my eyes. The past few years brought a number of challenges from many different directions, and changes at different levels. Some of those challenges and changes impacted the university, our students, and my teaching. Through those challenges, I have worked to provide my students with the best experience, knowledge, and skills possible.
          
          <p>I teach 4 different Computer Science courses on a regular basis: CIS 203 Computer Science II, CIS 303 Analysis of Algorithms, CIS 380 Professional Practice, and CIS 405 Software Engineering. I have also taught CIS 201 Computer Science I, CIS 205 (lab) CIS 280 Selected Languages (Python), CIS 421 Artificial Intelligence, and CIS 495 Special Topics (Bio-inspired Artificial Intelligence). For 3 semesters beginning in Fall 2020, I had the great pleasure of teaching a section of WAYS 103 Algorithms of Oppression. I also regularly supervise students in Capstone experiences, either as senior projects (CIS 480) or internships (CIS 490). With every offering of a course, I update content according to changes in the field that relate to the topic and to student feedback from the previous iteration of the course. For example, CIS 203 now introduces students to Git version control, a standard tool in the software industry. Recent classes of CIS 405 use industry-standard tools and methods that students include on their resumes. For CIS 421 Artificial Intelligence in Fall 2024, I will update the course content to include deep learning and large language models, technologies that have emerged since the last time the course was offered.

          <p>Working as part of a team is a critical skill for computer science students. To build those skills, I include group activity in class as much as possible, culminating in a major team software development project in CIS 405. I encourage students to keep up with course content by having weekly quizzes to give students frequent feedback about how well they understand a topic. I also hope that these types of activities will encourage class attendance and attention. All my courses emphasize real-world application of concepts and skills, incorporating practical uses of material that may otherwise seem theoretical. The connection to practice gives students better context for understanding concepts and helps maintain interest and commitment to the work.

          <p>The COVID pandemic of 2020-2021 required me to be more agile in my approaches and more cognizant of stress and fatigue in my students. When we shifted to remote instruction in March 2020, I conducted most of my classes asynchronously, in an effort to accommodate the different situations that students may be in. The exception to this was a weekly synchronous meeting of the software engineering class (CIS 405), for the weekly reviews. For Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, I changed to synchronous virtual class meetings, in an effort to be better connected to and engaged with the students. As difficult as those times were, I think I came away with better skills for organizing online material for students. The department has also maintained its Discord server that we set up as the department communication hub during the pandemic, supporting fast communication between students and faculty outside of regular on-campus hours.

          <p>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to teach outside of Computer Science in 2020-2021, when I taught a section of WAYS 103 Algorithms of Oppression. Dr. Brian Ladd and I co-developed the section and gained approval for it in the spring of 2020. I taught the section 3 times (Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Fall 2021) and loved my experiences with each group of students. Besides being able to share a topic that I care deeply about--namely algorithmic bias and the dangers of discrimination reinforced by artificial intelligence systems--I enjoyed the opportunity to work with students from many disciplines. The students in WAYS 103 brought interesting perspectives and experiences and I feel that I learned at least as much from them as they did from the experiences I provided in the course.

          <p>It should go without saying that a strong curriculum is essential to good teaching. Computer science changes rapidly and unceasingly, requiring frequent review and updating of degree programs. In response to changes in the field and changes in the preparation of our students, the Computer Science Department undertook a redesign of our curriculum. This process began in 2018, well before the pandemic and the current financial crisis. The result of this process is an updated curriculum that leverages the strength of the previous program, strengthens the introductory course sequence with a third foundational programming course, and provides Bachelor of Science students the opportunity to concentrate on areas of high current and future job growth. The curriculum redesign was highly collaborative, with Dr. Supraja Gurajala leading in the design of the Data Analytics track and Dr. Brian Ladd led the Cybersecurity track design. I contributed actively to those designs, particularly in helping to draft new course proposals and working with committees and administrators in the approval process. I was responsible for other aspects of the curriculum process that are more appropriately highlighted as service rather than teaching.

          <p>Recently, the SUNY Potsdam community has collectively devoted more energy to assessment processes to support continual improvement. This attention to assessment has impacted my teaching directly. I am much more aware of connecting levels of outcomes when designing assignments and other assessments. I strive to ensure that all course content I am presenting and any work the students do directly support student learning outcomes for the course, and that the course outcomes in turn support the program outcomes. As I improv my own assessment knowledge and skills, I hope that the content I deliver to my students will become clearer and better focused, which will in turn improve both student outcomes and experiences in the courses.

          <p>My research interests are Artificial Life (ALife) and Computer Science Education. ALife is within the larger field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and typically uses methods that involve evolutionary approaches to investigate the central questions of what makes a living system "alive" and where the boundaries between living and non-living systems. In computer science education, I am particularly interested in increasing participation of underrepresented groups in computing and technology fields.
          
          <p>I participate actively in a variety of scholarly activities related to my research specializations, Artificial Life and Computer Science Education. I connect with my research community through publications, presentations, technical committees, journal reviews, and grant applications.

          <p>I am particularly proud that my research earned me a place as a co-author on the 2020 review paper, "The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution: A Collection of Anecdotes from the Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life Research Communities", published in <em>Artificial Life</em>, the top journal in my research field. In this paper, my work stands besides work of many of the best known and most important researchers in the field. In 2021, I co-authored a paper with Dr. Christine Reilly of Skidmore College, "Improving the Success of Non-Traditional Students in an Introductory Computing Course: An Experience Report", presented at the IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) and published in the conference proceedings.

          <p>I have presented at several professional meetings recently, including an invited talk at Michigan State University and as a panelist in Clarkson's 2021  Virtual Film Series on the topic of algorithmic bias. I am a regular technical committee member for the Artificial Life Conference and a reviewer for <em>Artificial Life</em> journal. I was the Principal Investigator (PI) on grant proposals to the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2017 and 2018, "SUNY Potsdam Computer Science (SPOCS) Scholarship Program, National Science Foundation" (unfunded) and have participated as a co-PI or senior personnel on several other grants. Currently, I am participating in as a mentor in a grant proposal to the NSF led by Dr. Fadi Bou-Abdallah, "S-STEM “ELITES”: Enabling Learning Initiatives to Transform and Empower STEM Students" (pending).

          <p>Since being awarded continuing appointment and becoming department chair in 2018, my service roles have expanded greatly.  The two service roles that have been the most impactful and deserve to be highlighted are my service as Computer Science Department Chair and service as Faculty Senate Vice-chair.
          
          <p>Much has happened since I became department chair in 2018; times have often been turbulent and challenging, and the landscape has changed significantly in the past 6 years. Through everything, the Computer Science Department faculty work together toward our goals, with our students' success and well-being always the top priority. We solve problems collectively. As department chair, I often serve as the liaison and advocate for our students, programs, department, and faculty in conversations outside the department. Along with the rest of our university community, Computer Science has surmounted several big challenges in recent years: the pandemic, SUNY Potsdam's realignment process, institutional implementation of assessment,  enrollment declines, and the financial situation. As department chair, I have done my best to advocate for Computer Science students, programs, and faculty, and make space for our department faculty to work together to address problems.

          <p>During the COVID pandemic of March 2020-May 2021, Computer Science went to fully virtual instruction. When the initial lockdown was announced in March 2020, the department faculty made decisions and set up technology tools to support moving online within 24 hours of the announcement of the shift to virtual. We received very positive feedback from students about the speed of our transition and the level of communication we provided throughout that semester. The return to in-person instruction in Fall 2021 was accompanied by changes in university leadership and the academic realignment process. In concert with my Computer Science colleagues, I spearheaded the return of our programs to full status by spring 2022.

          <p>The increased awareness of assessment across the university presented challenges but is a positive development in the end. Discussions of assessment have become part of the fabric of department conversations about curriculum. I have taken on the responsibility of writing the department's assessment documents, with feedback, edits, and approval by the other Computer Science faculty.

          <p>In August 2023, Computer Science gained approval by SUNY and SED of revised curricula for both our Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees. The process of designing the new programs began in 2018, and by Spring 2023 the changes had been approved through all levels at SUNY Potsdam. I shepherded our curriculum revisions through many steps of the approval process and fielded questions when they arose.

          <p>In recent months, it was decided that the long-time home of Computer Science, Dunn Hall, will be closed and demolished. I have been deeply involved in the process of finding a new home for Computer Science that will meet the needs of our students and programs. The prospect of moving is both exciting and intimidating, and I look forward to the opportunity to increase Computer Science's visibility in a new location.
          
          <p>Serving as Faculty Senate Vice-chair was a very different kind of experience. I was elected in spring 2020 and served the full 2-year term. It was my pleasure to serve beside Faculty Senate Chair Dr. Blair Madore and many colleagues from across the university. As already noted, 2020-2022 was a difficult time and brought on many hard conversations. I attended Faculty Senate meetings, assisting with running those virtual meetings and attended weekly Faculty Senate Executive Committee Meetings. I was honored to be able to serve the SUNY Potsdam faculty in that role.

          <p>I served as Faculty Senate Delegate for 3 years, and I am currently a member of two Faculty Senate Committees, Academic Programs and Curriculum Committee and Business Affairs Committee. I was elected as an at-large delegate to the Arts and Sciences Council in 2017 and continue to serve in that body as department chair. I am on the CSTEP Advisory Board and am active in the STEM programs group. I am also a member o the Jefferson County Community College Computer Science Advisory Board. In 2019 and 2020, I was a member of search committees for Chief Information Officer and a STEM Teaching Faculty Visiting Assisting Professor. I am currently a member of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Working Group.
